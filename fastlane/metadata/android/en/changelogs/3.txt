* Refactor `QuranMediaService` and `Drawable` Handling
   > - Refactored `QuranMediaService` for improved stability and state management by introducing a robust state machine, error handling, and a retry mechanism for playback failures.
   > - Added comprehensive KDoc documentation to `QuranMediaService` and its components to clarify its responsibilities and usage.
   > - Created a `DrawableResUtil` utility to centralize and simplify the retrieval of surah drawable resources, replacing a discouraged API usage (`resources.getIdentifier`).
