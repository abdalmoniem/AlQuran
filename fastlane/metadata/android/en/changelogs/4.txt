* Refactor: Modernized Player UI and Improved Serialization
   > This commit introduces a significant visual and functional overhaul of the media player's progress bar. It also includes several code refinements for better serialization and previewing capabilities.
   > - **Player Screen (`FullScreenPlayer.kt`):**
   >     - Replaced the default `Slider` and `LinearProgressIndicator` with custom composables (`SliderThumb`, `SliderTrack`, `BufferProgressIndicator`, `BufferingIndicator`) for a more modern and visually appealing look and feel.
   >     - Added a pulsing animation for the buffering state.
   >     - Refactored the media player's progress bar for a completely custom look and feel.
   > - **Serialization (`SerializableExt.kt`):**
   >     - Introduced `SerializableExt.kt` with extension functions (`asJsonString`, `toJsonString`) to centralize object-to-JSON conversion using Gson.
   >     - Updated `RecitersScreen.kt` and `PlayerWidget.kt` to use these new serialization extensions, simplifying the code.
   > - **UI & Code Quality:**
   >     - Added a `@Preview` composable for the `RecitersScreen` to facilitate easier UI development and testing.
   >     - Refined code structure in `RecitersScreen.kt` for improved readability.
   >     - Simplified logic in `RecitersScreen.kt` using a `when` expression for content display.
   >     - Added a preview for `RecitersScreen` to facilitate UI development.
   >     - Improved null safety in `PlayerWidget.kt` before updating glance widgets.
